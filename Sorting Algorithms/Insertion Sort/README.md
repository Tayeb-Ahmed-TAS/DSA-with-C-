# Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands. It is a comparison-based algorithm that builds a final sorted list one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
