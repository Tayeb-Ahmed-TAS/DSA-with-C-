# Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands. It is a comparison-based algorithm that builds a final sorted list one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

## How it works?

Insertion Sort algorithm uses the technique of selecting a key in each iteration starting from the second element. Next, we make the proper position available for the key by shifting all the greater elements before it toward their right for sorting in ascending order. Finally, the selected key is stored before the last shifted greater element.
